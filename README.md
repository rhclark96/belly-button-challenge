Bootcamp Module 14 Challenge
App Deployed to https://rhclark96.github.io/

Throughout this challenge, I found a lot of obstacles and relied heavily on the help of the Xpert Learning Assitant to correct my code or point me in the correct direction of how to get started. 

The builing of charts using Plotly and even the creation of the metadata panel were both fairly straightfowrward and I needed less assistance, however it was the init() function and drop down menu that provided me the greatest challenge, and a significant portion of this code was provided by Xpert Learning Assitant. However, after having the Xpert Learning Assitant explain each of the lines of code I feel significantly more confident in my understanding of these commands.
